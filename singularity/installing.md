## Installing singularity

Singularity is already installed for you on both the training virtual machines and on darwin.

To install on your own machine, follow the instructions in the [singularity user guide](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-quick-start-installation). We are using version 2.3 for this workshop to get the most up-to-date support for running applications that make use of GPU compute.

Installing singularity on your own machine (where you have root/sudo access) will let you create new images either from scratch or from the software that you have installed.
